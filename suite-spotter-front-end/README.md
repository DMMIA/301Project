# React + Vite

#notes from Andrea
comments from activities page line 18:
  // get the start date and end date from the form. then define it as a const. pass this data to the server through the /weather api call. (i think its checkIn and checkOut)
  // define searchQuery for axios calls
  // make sure data mapping is working. 


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
