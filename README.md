301 Final Project


Group Project: Team Agreement
The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.
Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.
Planning
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.
Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.
Deliverable
Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.
Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
