The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## **Planning**

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## **Deliverable**

Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

### **Cooperation Plan**

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

* What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
  * Communicate: Clearly define tasks and plans of actions to complete those tasks.
  * Cooperation: Assist each other when needed.
  * Reassurance: Consistently reassuring team members that they are capable and we are more than mission ready as a team.
  * Flexibility: Being able to adapt to changes quickly

**_NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here._**

### **Conflict Plan**

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

* What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  * Communication and Collaboration

  * Sticking to ownership of one’s tasks, unless help is requested.
* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  * Accountability: Understanding and accepting personal skill level and cooperating with the team respectively.
  * Being respectful of each other's levels.
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  * Discuss any concerns in team meetings/discussions.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  * Plan: Inform lead instructor if and when and individuals actions or in-actions become detrimental to teams overall success.

### **Communication Plan**

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

* What hours will you be available to communicate?
  * 9-6 PST | 12-9 EST

  * Respectful behavior.
  * Enthusiastic collaboration.
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  * Respectful behavior.
  * Enthusiastic collaboration.

### **Work Plan**

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

**_NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks._**

Describe at least:

* How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  * Realize tasks once project details are fleshed out.
  * Trello board utilization.
  * Constant communication.
* What project management tool will be used?
  * Trello

### **Presentation Deck**

Make a single copy of the [Presentation Deck Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NeXKKEpjK2DDme8EwlZBsJndUqIgGYzWrY6FAYtNTf0/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31). Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

[Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19SO5PUezM4pvc-hWtctQ-vTD7wD6oHyy8trJOtAh2Qk/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31)

### **Schedule your practice session**

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

* Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
* When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
* Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

* How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  * GitHub Organization
* What is your Git flow?
  * Code in individual branches
  * Review pull requests before merging into main branch.
* Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  * How many people must review a PR?

  * Who merges PRs?
    * Immanuel
  * How often will you merge?
    * Upon completion of major feature
    * Upon completion of branch’s scope
  * How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

## **Submitting Your Work**

This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.

Submit a link to your GitHub markdown file where you have created your Team Agreement.

This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review.
